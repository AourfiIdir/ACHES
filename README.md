# ACHES
The Achi game is a traditional strategy game from Ghana, often compared to tic-tac-toe but with some variations. This game is played by two players, and its board typically consists of a 3x3 grid with diagonals connecting the opposite corners, forming a star.

# RULES
1 Setup: Each player has three pieces, with different colors to distinguish them.
2 Objective: The goal of the game is to align all three pieces of a player in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, just like in tic-tac-toe.
3 Gameplay:
Players take turns placing their three pieces one by one on the grid.
Once all pieces are placed, if no player has won yet, the game continues. Players then move their existing pieces to an adjacent square, following the lines of the board.
4 Restrictions: Moves can only be made to an adjacent, unoccupied square.
5 End of the game: The first player to align all three of their pieces in a row wins the game.
